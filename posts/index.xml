      <title>HackTheBox: OWASP Top 10 Track</title>

      <description>Introduction HackTheBox&amp;rsquo;s OWASP Top 10 track gives players the opportunity to &amp;lsquo;[exploit] the most critical security risks to web applications&amp;rsquo;. The OWASP Top 10 contains the likes of &amp;lsquo;broken access control&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;injection&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;insecure design&amp;rsquo;, and each of the challenges in this track replicates 1 or more of these vulnerabilities for players to exploit.&#xA;Web exploitation is currently my favourite area of pen testing. Most of these challenges were pretty straightforward; a few of the challenges really stumped me and I had to look at online walkthroughs for hints.</description>

      <title>OverTheWire: Krypton</title>

      <description>Introduction Krypton is centred around cryptography. To me, the most challenging aspect of this wargame was the need to create custom tools and/or perform manual decryption. For example, in one of the levels I spent three hours trying to code a frequency analysis tool, before giving up and using an existing online tool - this helped me solve the problem in less than a minute. The concepts covered are relatively straightforward to understand, but putting them into practice was rather tedious and/or complicated (without the online tools).</description>

      <description>Introduction Natas lets us practice web application penetration testing. Most of the levels were adequately challenging; the last few levels referenced unfamiliar techniques and vulnerabilities I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of, and I had to refer to guides and walkthroughs to complete them.&#xA;Nevertheless, I enjoyed completing the challenges. I learnt a lot of new concepts and had the chance to apply my knowledge by practicing many cool techniques, including:&#xA;deploying webshells for remote code execution using path traversal and insecure direct object reference spotting command injection opportunities conducting time based SQL injections performing PHP object injection using PHAR deserialisation for object injection spotting exploitable vulnerabilities in perl scripting for brute force exploits Overall, I am quite happy with what I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten out of completing these challenges.</description>

      <title>CSIT Mobile Reverse Engineering Mini-Challenge (CNY 2024)</title>

      <description>Introduction CSIT periodically releases challenges to &amp;lsquo;create awareness on the various tech focus areas of CSIT&amp;rsquo;. The topic of their CNY 2024 mini-challenge was mobile reverse engineering. I had minimal experience in this topic but I decided to give it a shot nonetheless. The following is an account of my thought process, how I understood the concepts I encountered, and how I solved the problems I encountered along the way (spoiler: G _ _ _ _ e).</description>

      <title>OverTheWire: Leviathan</title>
      <link>https://whoisjustinngo.github.io/posts/over-the-wire-leviathan/</link>

      <description>Introduction This is my writeup for OverTheWire&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Leviathan&amp;rsquo; wargame. This is the second OverTheWire wargame I&amp;rsquo;m trying (after &amp;lsquo;Bandit&amp;rsquo;). This game is much shorter than Bandit, having only 7 levels, but, unlike Bandit, Leviathan doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any problem statements or recommended commands â€“ you just log in to the server and find the flag somewhere on it. Leviathan is the second wargame OverTheWire recommends you to play (after Bandit), and the difficulty level is supposedly 1/10.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is my writeup for OverTheWire&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Bandit&amp;rsquo; wargame, which is essentially a capture the flag (CTF) challenge with the flag in each level being a password you&amp;rsquo;ll need to ssh into the next level. Each level has a problem statement indicating the location of the password on the server, in addition to some useful commands one might need to retrieve it.&#xA;Please look at the OverTheWire Bandit website for the problem statements.</description>
