      <description>Introduction This is my writeup for OverTheWire&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Bandit&amp;rsquo; wargame, which is essentially a capture the flag (CTF) challenge with the flag in each level being a password you&amp;rsquo;ll need to ssh into the next level. Each level has a problem statement indicating the location of the password on the server, in addition to some useful commands one might need to retrieve it.
Please look at the OverTheWire Bandit website for the problem statements.</description>

      <description>Hi there!
My name is Justin, and I&amp;rsquo;m an aspiring cybersecurity professional. I graduated with a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Philosophy in June 2023. I also did a second major in Computer Science during my time in University. Before University, I was neither interested in tech nor considered a career in it. It was only after doing a mandatory computational reasoning module did I find out that I enjoyed the process of solving problems computationally, and by extension, coding.</description>
