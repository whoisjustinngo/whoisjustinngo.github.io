      <description>Introduction Krypton is centred around cryptography. To me, the most challenging aspect of this wargame was the need to create custom tools and/or perform manual decryption. For example, in one of the levels I spent three hours trying to code a frequency analysis tool, before giving up and using an existing online tool - this helped me solve the problem in less than a minute. The concepts covered are relatively straightforward to understand, but putting them into practice was rather tedious and/or complicated (without the online tools).</description>
