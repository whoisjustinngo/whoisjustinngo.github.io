      <description>Introduction HackTheBox&amp;rsquo;s OWASP Top 10 track gives players the opportunity to &amp;lsquo;[exploit] the most critical security risks to web applications&amp;rsquo;. The OWASP Top 10 contains the likes of &amp;lsquo;broken access control&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;injection&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;insecure design&amp;rsquo;, and each of the challenges in this track replicates 1 or more of these vulnerabilities for players to exploit.&#xA;Web exploitation is currently my favourite area of pen testing. Most of these challenges were pretty straightforward; a few of the challenges really stumped me and I had to look at online walkthroughs for hints.</description>

      <description>Introduction Natas lets us practice web application penetration testing. Most of the levels were adequately challenging; the last few levels referenced unfamiliar techniques and vulnerabilities I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of, and I had to refer to guides and walkthroughs to complete them.&#xA;Nevertheless, I enjoyed completing the challenges. I learnt a lot of new concepts and had the chance to apply my knowledge by practicing many cool techniques, including:&#xA;deploying webshells for remote code execution using path traversal and insecure direct object reference spotting command injection opportunities conducting time based SQL injections performing PHP object injection using PHAR deserialisation for object injection spotting exploitable vulnerabilities in perl scripting for brute force exploits Overall, I am quite happy with what I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten out of completing these challenges.</description>
